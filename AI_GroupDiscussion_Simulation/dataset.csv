Host,"Okay let's begin , So Topic 1 , we won't spend much time because it was 8.05 pm already so ( with second) intention among Malaysian you all of us are Malaysian including me . Okay we are living in Malaysia. We have a very harmony place. Where all races are staying together in one place which I’m very happy . For me actually , I like a place there are Indians, there are Malay , there are Chinese together. I like this kind of environment, its very harmony okay. So, In this context Malaysian you. In your opinion. What do you think about recycling intentions among youth and what motivate or demotivate them? How about yourself, okay? So we randomly pick , I mean randomly go around okay? Maybe some of you can start first okay? Not necessarily follow your names or whoever or sequence okay? Shall we start now? Maybe I’ll pick you up, I’ll pick some of you? Maybe Rooben you can tell me in general what do you think about Recycling Intention among youth? what motivate or demotivate them to do it? How about yourself?",7,6,5,6,6,"The host introduces the discussion with a broad context about Malaysia’s multicultural harmony, but the connection to recycling could be stronger.","The introduction jumps between thoughts, making the transition to recycling intentions slightly disjointed.","The introduction does not delve into recycling issues but rather focuses on cultural unity, which may not be directly relevant.","Some phrases are repetitive, and the structure of the question could be more concise.","Basic language is used effectively, but there are redundant phrases like 'Maybe I’ll pick you up, I’ll pick some of you'.",Introduce recycling relevance sooner instead of focusing too much on Malaysia’s multiculturalism.,Make the transition to the main question more seamless.,Mention key factors influencing youth recycling behavior before asking for opinions.,Reduce redundant phrases to improve engagement.,Use a more precise way of framing the question to keep the discussion structured.
Ro,"Actually like what motivates people, I mean especially teenagers to do recycle is because there is I mean like when they have exciting activities and that related to recycling that’s when they will try to participate in things like that but what demotivate them is that they do not like understand or do not fully know or haven't learn about the effects of recycling and effects of not recycling and people like putting them down for not knowing those things at all, and then like, I have personally felt, I mean I have personally seen people usually put down someone for not understanding or not knowing the effects of not recycling so I mean that’s one thing that you know could potentially you know lose people to lose interest on recycling.",8,6,7,5,5,The response directly addresses the topic by discussing both motivation and demotivation factors for youth recycling behavior.,"The structure is somewhat scattered, with repetitive phrases and ideas that could be presented more clearly.","The speaker provides personal observations and social influences, which add depth, but the argument lacks supporting data or specific examples.","Frequent use of filler words ('like', 'I mean') and long, winding sentences reduce clarity.","Informal and conversational tone, but excessive repetition weakens the impact of key points.",Maintain focus on recycling factors without unnecessary repetition.,"Organize thoughts more clearly, separating points on motivation and demotivation for better readability.","Include concrete examples, such as successful recycling initiatives for youth engagement.",Reduce filler words and structure sentences more concisely.,Use a more structured and precise approach to strengthen arguments.

Ro,"I mean myself I like learning new things so that means I love learning about what you know what the effects and cause of you know not recycling or the causes of landfill and all of that so that’s mean I am very aware but like because like where I stay they do not have proper recycling schedule, so that’s the reason why you know it's quite hard for us here like the area I stay in Klang to you know practise to practise it.",8,6,7,5,5,The response directly relates to personal experience with recycling and environmental awareness.,"There are some run-on sentences and repetitions, making it slightly difficult to follow.",The speaker provides insights into their learning interest and the challenges of recycling in their area.,Frequent use of 'you know' and 'like' makes the response less polished.,"The language is informal and repetitive, reducing its impact.",Maintain focus on recycling challenges and solutions.,Structure the response more clearly by separating ideas into distinct points.,Provide a specific example of how lack of a recycling schedule affects behavior.,Reduce filler words and repetitions for a more precise statement.,Use varied vocabulary to express thoughts more effectively.

You can use Malay if you want. No problem S: Hello, can everyone hear me?",7,6,5,6,6,The response is relevant as it relates to the discussion on recycling accessibility but does not introduce new insights.,The transition from sharing a personal experience to asking Sahira to speak is somewhat abrupt.,The statement acknowledges a common issue but does not explore potential solutions or deeper reasoning.,"The structure is understandable, but the phrasing could be smoother, particularly the invitation to speak.","Simple and effective, but 'Can you tell me ehmm express something?' could be more naturally phrased.",Provide a clearer connection between personal experience and the broader discussion.,Make the transition to inviting Sahira more seamless.,Expand on how the lack of recycling bins affects behavior.,Reword the question to be more inviting and structured.,"Avoid filler words like 'ehmm' and restructure the invitation to be clearer, e.g., 'Sahira, would you like to share your thoughts on this?'"

S,"I think one of the reason, one of the facts demotivate me personally is we had to organise each of the stuff like for example all plastic or wrap of the plastics in plastics item and for glass in glass, in which we had to sort on all the stuff so it's kind of a bit hard. Not hard really hmm too much work yeah too much work ,yeah",7,6,5,5,5,The response is relevant as it identifies sorting waste as a demotivating factor for recycling.,The reasoning is clear but slightly repetitive and hesitant ('Not hard really hmm too much work yeah too much work').,It mentions sorting waste but does not elaborate on possible solutions or comparisons to other systems.,"The sentence structure is somewhat disorganized, with repeated phrases and hesitations making it less clear.","Basic vocabulary is used effectively but could be improved for clarity, e.g., 'organise each of the stuff' should be 'organise waste by type'.",Further explain why sorting is difficult and how it affects overall recycling habits.,Streamline the response by removing redundant phrases to make it more concise.,"Consider adding a suggestion, e.g., 'If there were easier ways to recycle, like single-bin systems, I might be more motivated.'","Rephrase for better clarity, e.g., 'Sorting waste by type can be tedious, which makes recycling feel like too much work for me.'",Avoid filler words and use more precise wording to convey thoughts effectively.

S,"Yeah we might be thinking like oh there is so much things to do so uhmm, why if I just throw it just like that?",7,6,5,5,5,"The response is relevant as it reflects a common reason why youth may not recycle, which is the perceived effort required.","The sentence structure is slightly unclear, especially towards the end, making the thought process somewhat disjointed.",The argument lacks elaboration on why sorting waste is inconvenient or what might encourage recycling instead.,The phrase 'why if I just throw it just like that?' is grammatically incorrect and could be rephrased for better clarity.,"The response is informal with filler words like 'uhmm,' making it less structured.",The speaker could elaborate on the effort required for recycling and how it impacts motivation.,Rephrase the sentence to ensure a smooth flow of thoughts.,"Provide more depth by mentioning potential solutions, like convenient recycling facilities or incentives.","Rephrase the final part to something clearer like 'Sometimes we feel overwhelmed by the effort, so we might just throw it away instead.'",Reduce filler words and use more structured phrasing for a clearer message.

Farah,"I think that, the youth like these days they try to recycle more because they understand that global warming is a thing and that it will affect our generation the most, so they are gonna try their hardest to recycle and help ehmm basically save the earth . Basically that’s what motivates them like eh healthier environment in the future for them to live up safely and peacefully but I guess what demotivate’s them is probably the elders here they dont try to recycle because they think it's it won't affect them so they just like you know will just throw it there’s nothing wrong with just throw there’s nothing wrong with just you know throwing without sorting it or not re-using them, so I guess when the youth see them like not putting effort,they think their effort is nothing is just like ehh just a small piece of change like it wont help a lot so that might demotivate them and they just don't recycle at all yeah.",8,6,7,5,5,"Farah addresses the topic directly, discussing both motivations and demotivations for recycling among youth.","The argument flows logically, but there are some repetitive and disjointed parts that could be structured better.","She provides a valid perspective, highlighting both generational differences and environmental awareness.

Farah,For me I try my best to recycle like if I have plastic or tins I wash them and I keep them for future used not sure what but it’s there ehmm but if I’m outside if there is like trash cans that you know that separate all the different types of trash I’ll do my best to sort them but if don't have then just you know I don't put the effort to sort it outside la.,8,7,6,6,6,"Farah provides a personal perspective on recycling habits, making it relevant to the discussion.","The response follows a logical order, explaining both home and outdoor recycling behaviors.",The response provides insight into motivation but lacks depth on broader recycling challenges or potential improvements.,"Some phrases are slightly disorganized, and filler words like 'ehmm' reduce clarity.","Simple and understandable, but minor grammatical issues and informal language (e.g., 'la') affect formal discussion quality.",Expand on why sorting trash outside feels less important or what could encourage better habits.,Make a clearer distinction between home and outdoor recycling to enhance structure.,Discuss possible solutions or personal challenges in maintaining recycling habits.,Reduce filler words and improve sentence structure for smoother delivery.,Use more structured phrasing instead of informal expressions like 'la' for a formal discussion setting.

Farah,I think because of the leaderboard a lot of people would feel like they have to do something they have to compete so that their names wont be at the bottom and because of that we are force to like watch all this video and learn about recycling and by the end of the day they have this knowledge and they will like “ oh since I know maybe I’ll just put them to use” so I think like the leaderboard at least they might just make someone know about recycling more an probably make that person practise recycling in their daily lives.

So I know some of you think that leaderboard is good so you won’t be at the bottom so you are always above your friend in the class. So that is one of the things we are afraid of losing. So move on to collect game classroom engagement. First one do you think participation edcraft is able to engage youth in recycling? So in short will this edcraft actually engage youth in recycling?

Do you think topic 3, Do you think social influence is important to motivate you in edcraft? So the social influence here is maybe when you saw the leaderboard you will see your friend really hardworking when you saw your friend really speak something that affects you all of these factors affecting you to motivate you to move you to go in further to kick you on and even more motivated than before will this affect you?

Farah,I’ll start then. Hmm video creation is important so that the judges can see that you actually did it and how you did it like the skill and all but I think like macam the editing I dont think it should be important I dont think it should matter much because the point of the programme is just to see your creation like the editingit add a bit more pressure when you see like other people make it beautiful and then they get so its like an edit pressure and edit burden even though the target is just to make you create stuff using recycle items so yeah.,7,6,6,5,5,"Farah discusses the importance of video creation in showcasing work to the judges but shifts focus to the pressure of editing, which slightly diverts from the main topic.","The argument moves logically from why video creation is important to why editing shouldn't matter, though some sentences are long and unstructured.",She presents a reasonable argument about editing being an unnecessary burden but does not explore alternative perspectives or possible solutions.,"The explanation contains redundant phrases and informal expressions, making it less structured.",The language is casual with some unnecessary fillers like 'like' and 'macam'.

Rooban,Okay I think for video creation I feel like what Farah said is important for like to show the judges that we actually did it so it's like a prove like that we did it but when it came to like the evaluation and all of that like some of us didn't have time to like edit the video properly and all of that since it was very frustrating we also have other assignment as well. So back to the point system and all when it came to video creation as like one of the points that I added to the leaderboard like that it is a disadvantage to like those people who weren't particularly free to you know edit their video and all of that so that’s my opinion to it.,7,5,6,5,5,Rooban stays on topic and supports the argument about video creation's importance while also addressing the challenge of editing under time constraints.,The argument is repetitive and could be structured better to avoid run-on sentences.,He acknowledges the disadvantage of editing time constraints but does not suggest solutions.,Frequent use of 'like' and 'and all of that' makes the speech less concise.,Some phrases like 'it's like a prove' should be corrected to 'it’s proof.',Strengthen the argument by discussing whether video editing should impact the evaluation criteria.,Reorganize sentences to avoid unnecessary repetition.,Provide more insights on how students can manage time constraints for video editing.,Reduce filler words and improve sentence structure.,Use more precise wording and correct grammatical errors.

Farah,Okay now I talk. I think rewards are important because things like certificate they will be useful when you graduate and I think you can put it in your resume or something so you can show the company that you this did and that during the time you study and as for the prize since we are student like prize of money is helpful in many ways like they can used it for assignment and they can just used for essentials like foods and all that so I think it is important because by the end of the day these reward help them so yeah .,8,6,7,5,5,Farah effectively explains the importance of rewards with real-world applications.,The reasoning follows a logical structure but could be smoother.,"She discusses both certificates and monetary rewards, adding depth.",Some grammatical issues and sentence structure inconsistencies affect readability.,"There are multiple minor grammar mistakes, such as 'certificate they will be' and 'they can used it'.",Provide a stronger connection between certificates and career benefits.,Rearrange sentences for better coherence.,Explain further how different types of rewards motivate students differently.,Improve sentence construction for clarity.,Correct grammatical errors and use formal phrasing.

Rooban,I really agree with what Farah and Syahirah said but and also the reason why edcraft give me the satisfaction that I want it is because I find the sense of completion means like “ oh I did something” like I do something worthwhile that like you know focusing on video games and all of that and enjoyment in the sense where I get to learn new things in the fun way and then the pleasure of completing like trying to get the top spot and all of that and to get prize like you know getting the satisfying side of me.,8,5,6,5,5,"The response is directly relevant to the topic, emphasizing satisfaction and achievement.","The explanation is a bit disorganized, with ideas blending together without clear separation.",Touches on personal motivation but lacks deeper reasoning or broader implications.,"The response contains several long-winded and redundant phrases, making it slightly difficult to follow.",Repeated phrases like 'like you know' and informal structure lower the overall clarity and effectiveness.,Introduce a more structured explanation of why Edcraft feels rewarding.,"Break thoughts into clearer, more structured sentences.",Discuss specific elements of Edcraft that make it enjoyable and how they could be enhanced.,Reduce redundancy and clarify thoughts for better understanding.,Use more precise wording instead of informal fillers like 'like you know'.

Speaker 1,well uh what I want to talk about first is a documentary I made for Radio 4 last year to Mark the the 25th anniversary of proac a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor uh most of you will be familiar with this category of neuropharmacology uh statistically a substantial number of you in this Hall tonight will be taking an SSRI it's just a fact something like 20 million prescriptions for these drugs are written every year in this country when I went into making the documentary for Radio 4 I really tried to keep an open mind on the,8,7,7,6,7,The speaker introduces a specific and relevant case (a documentary on SSRIs) and ties it to the audience.,"Logical progression into the subject matter is smooth, building context with statistics.","The speaker references both personal and general data, which adds weight.",The use of filler words and repetition makes delivery slightly less clear.,"Good use of factual and medical vocabulary, though a bit wordy.",Eliminate filler words and redundancies.,Maintain the flow with a tighter structure.,Further detail on documentary findings could strengthen depth.,Simplify phrasing to enhance directness.,Maintain precise medical terms but vary sentence structure.
Speaker 1,subject but my background view was that the selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors were overprescribed my feeling was because I come from that kind of place and generation was that these drugs were mostly often being prescribed for what used to be called exogamous depression in other words depressions that are caused by things like your partner leaving you losing a job an illness rather than for endogamous depressions depressions that are caused by a chemical imbalance but beyond that I didn't really have any strong views,8,8,7,7,7,"Clear stance is taken on overprescription, and distinction between depression types adds relevance.","Argument flows well, clarifying terms for the audience.",The speaker reflects on societal and medical trends with a balanced viewpoint.,Explanation is accessible despite complex terminology.,Appropriate use of technical and layman terms makes it effective.,Could briefly state the implications of overprescription.,Maintain flow but connect examples to larger argument earlier.,Explore potential consequences of misdiagnosis or mistreatment.,Break up long sentences for clarity.,No major change; balance of terms is well-handled.
Speaker 1,about ssris or at least I didn't think I did and what I discovered as I researched for this program and as I talked to people was that what I had assumed to be the causal mechanism for these drugs which was that they rectified the low serotonin levels uh in people's brains that caused them to be depressed that this causal mechanism had long since been disproved by Medical Science and indeed when I interviewed for the program the head of marketing and Eli Lily the pharmaceutical company that produced,9,9,8,8,8,"Highly relevant and informative, highlighting a critical medical misconception.",Very strong progression from personal assumption to researched contradiction.,Introduces authoritative contradiction to popular beliefs about SSRIs.,Clear communication of a complex scientific point.,Excellent academic and conversational balance in language.,None needed.,Maintains logical structure effectively.,Consider briefly noting the impact of this misinformation.,Already clear; possibly break up long sentence slightly.,Language is fitting; no major revision needed.
